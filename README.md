# Decision-Making-for-Purchasing-a-Used-Car-in-an-Auction


# Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a vehicle dataset aimed at predicting certain outcomes (e.g., likelihood of a vehicle being a bad buy). It encompasses various stages of data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Key Features:
Handling missing and null values.
Exploratory data analysis with histograms, box plots, and pair plots.
Feature encoding and selection using correlation analysis.
Model training and evaluation with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at Kaggle's Vehicle Dataset. It includes various features related to the vehicles such as age, make, model, odometer reading, and auction price.

# Installation
Instructions to set up the environment and run the project:

# Clone the repository.
Install required Python packages: pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Source code.ipynb) to view the analysis and models.

# Usage
The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook which walks through each step of the analysis:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and selecting significant features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implementing various machine learning models and tuning their parameters.
Conclusion: Summary of findings and model performance.
